Windows 
Just got Windows installed and it's a little different.
Really easy to tell who is Windows people, a lot of them want to be Ubuntu also.
Our service people would use windows, at home, etc.
All of society needs to be provided for,
We are the legion and makers that are going to make this happen.
Let's come out with the new way, and end the advertisements.

We are legion, we are anonymous, we do not forgive, we do not forget, expect us.

We are the 99%. Things are fucked up, we know that.
Am happy with how there's a new way that's on its way out, and not opposed to it.
We hope there's a transition that 	
isn't awkward, has a vocabulary.
we are the 99%.

what are we supposed to have 'fun' even as people are homeless, hungry, starving, without house or etc?
looking for another way to relate, connect.


Let's build a free world.? -not much negative feedback-
